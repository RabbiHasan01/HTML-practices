    <p class="my-style">The border between Asia and the region of Oceania is usually placed somewhere 
    in the Malay Archipelago. The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on 
    the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of 
    Oceania. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several 
    vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which
    islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of 
    the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert,
    "The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process. </p>
